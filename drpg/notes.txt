I transcribed everything, my /scripts/ is still untested. I'm running docker-compose up --build
The sql server host should be drp_db_1
I changed the host name in settings.py, and the container names in docker-compose.yml
I'm running mysql on the container, and creating the appropriate user and table

From stack overflow:
SET PASSWORD = PASSWORD('your_new_password');

I ran the commands from my scripts manually, and I think I set things up properly.
